        <p>
          I, <a href="introduction.html">Giancarlo A. Kite</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 WEB215 Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
          I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br><br>
          Signed: <i>Giancarlo A. Kite, 12/02/2024</i>
